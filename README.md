# MNIST Attempt
* Task: Write and train an MLP in PyTorch to solve MNIST

Since this is a learning exercise, there's some ground rules:
* No autonomous AI code generation. Github Copilot autocomplete is disabled.
* Web searches and documentation are fair game.
* Stackoverflow/solutions for when you really get stuck. With discretion. 
* Focus is on understanding the high-level concepts (but with enough knowledge to replicate the code)
